	@description = The Gaelean Historians Collective is a timeless non-profit organzation whose purpose has been to bring recognition to, and chronicle world firsts of all sorts. They tend to be fully able to financially encourage and reward individuals to do, and who have done the same. The local corporations attempt to bank on this as well, and fortunately for them, are not exempt from earning a signature in their receipt books, and a page in the Kuinness World Book of Records.
