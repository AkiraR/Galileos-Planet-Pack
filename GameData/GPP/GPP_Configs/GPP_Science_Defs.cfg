{
	@RESULTS
	{
	default = The material here is curious. Unfortunately its composition eludes you and your mind drifts toward the shiny part.
	GaelSrfLandedTundra = Frosty mud and dead grass... It personally displeases you but it will make for good science.
	GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You immediately feel a fair portion of the coldness in your hand as you scoop it. Your suit's integrity has been challenged.
	GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = You pick up something that seems non-living-- a mollusk or coral. It offers you its science.
	GaelSrfLandedUakoraShores = There isn't always sand at the border of land and sea. Today you learn that. End log.
	GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = You find something grass-like but it confounds you. Is this actually grass?
	GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = You find intriguing uncommon materials in the gritty and or loose material around you. You get that science. You get it!
	GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The ground is full of very dark, igneous materials. It's not brittle but it leaves black dusty stains on your hands.
	GaelSrfLandedMountains = The instrumentation determines nothing special in the rocks here. But you make a note to go hiking on your next vacation.
	GaelSrfLandedHighlands = We cannae give 'er anymahr' cap'n.  The highlands cannae take it!
	GaelSrfLandedMidlands = You envision a time where thousands of kerbals have spread across the quaint midlands creating the kerbal surburbia and shiver in horror.
	GaelSrfLandedLowlands = Roses are red, violets are blue. The grass is green and so are you. Wait...
	GaelSrfLandedReefs = You manage to catch something that's hard on the outside but alive. It makes a chirping noise or flicks something at you but it also offers some science.
	GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = The sand has many textures but is mostly wet. It holds your interest and makes you hold more of it. For science of course.
	GaelSrfLandedWater = The water is particularly messy here, especially when it's shallow enough to walk in and hence you raise sand in it by treading.
	GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = You pick up something smooth and wriggly. It's not a particularly gross thing so you happily science it.
	GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it back because sciencing it is for another team of scientists.
	GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = You find that the water carries a strong odor and is not fit for drinking. You wonder how the things that live in it, live.
	GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = You manage to catch an organism with your water sample. You throw it out with a frown, knowing you won't have the time or permission to mind pets.
	GaelSrfSplashedReefs = The sample contains sediments not found in other biomes. This fascinates you.
	GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = Compared to sea water, this sure seems thirst-quenching. But there are still things operating in it, other than you.
	GaelSrfSplashedWater = You find a great abundance of one or more elements that would please both chemists and hobbyist builders. The administration may be pleased with this find.
	
	IotaSrfLandedSkids = You grab at the pale, sandy surface and wonder if it is sugar, salt or spice.
	IotaSrfLandedHighlands = The pale and soft texture makes many snacks come to mind. You eagerly hope that R&D confirms that this moon was made for munching.
	IotaSrfLandedMidlands = It's mildly tanned and hard to break a piece off of. But you nail it. The challenging sample screams 'fudge' at you.
	IotaSrfLandedLowlands = The surface happens to yield easily in your grasp. You stow the piece and ponder over another one. For science, of course.
	IotaSrfLandedDroops = The crystalline soil challenges you to draw a pick axe. Since you came fully prepared the soil loses.
	
	CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = It's pale, its gritty, it's easy to scoop up and therefore, has been. Easy science.
	CetiSrfLandedHighlands = The pale crust of this moon proves difficult to break a piece off of with your hands. You bet it will, however, easily surrender to your teeth.
	CetiSrfLandedMidlands = The soft, colored soil crumbles easily and finds a place in a sample jar.
	CetiSrfLandedLowlands = You take up a fragment of the dark and oddly colored soil. You find find the blend of colors as gross up close as from any great distance, but you store it anyway.
	CetiSrfLandedPoles = You scrape up some of the muddy material. It oddly seems like caramel and is deemed quite worthy of the storage space on the ship.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
	default = You make notes.  It's about wherever you're at.  They're really interesting.  Can I read them?
	GaelInSpaceHigh = The extreme weightlessness makes the crew ponder things they normally wouldn't...like how long it would take to have snacks delivered to this height.
	GaelInSpaceLow = The clouds once mocked you with their altitude and speed... My, how the tables have turned!
	GaelFlyingHigh = You wish you had binoculars. It would be cool to try to spot the KSC with them.
	GaelFlyingLowTundra = Is... is that snow?!
	GaelFlyingLowIceCaps = The crew takes notice of the extraordinarily high amount of white below.
	GaelFlyingLowMinorShores = Flying low over the shore lines allows you to spot schools of fish, frothy dessert-like white caps and OH KRAKEN SAVE US THAT'S A BIG FREAKING SHARK!!!
	GaelFlyingLowUakoraShores = The blended colors and swirls of colors within the colors off this shoreline make you think of numerous candies and puddings.
	GaelFlyingLowPligiaShores = Even with altitude the colors of the shore line blend with each other in such a way that makes your eyes dance and unable to focus properly.
	GaelFlyingLowEucriaShores = The beauty of the Eucria Shores can be seen from any altitude kind of like your neighbor and a good pair of binoculars.  OH SCRATCH THAT!  ERASE, REWIND, SOMETHING!
	GaelFlyingLowVolcano = If this thing erupts now would you get a ribbon for that?  First Kerbal to be Forced EVA by a Volcano?
	GaelFlyingLowMountains = Climb faster.  CLIMB faster!  CLIMB FASTER!!!!  Did the altimeter catch that?  Hopefully no one reviews the black box.
	GaelFlyingLowHighlands = Whole flocks of sheep appear to be fleeing a large number of kerbals in kilts.
	GaelFlyingLowMidlands = Flat.  Featureless. Suburbs.  Boring.  END REPORT.
	GaelFlyingLowLowlands = The scientist in you tells you to concentrate on making notes regarding feature surfaces from altitude...the pilot in you eyes the wide open spaces and daydreams of extra wide landing strips.
	GaelFlyingLowReefs = You see extraordinarily green land in some places above sea level, but you also see land that's just barely below sea level.
	GaelFlyingLowInlandWater = You kontemplate bringing a dinghy and some friends to party here next time the space program eases up for vacations.
	GaelFlyingLowWater = There are so many colorful living things under the blue surface. If they have eyes they must surely be looking up in envy now.
	GaelSrfLandedTundra = Well you thought the surface was solid anyway...now you're stuck up to the top of the gear struts in frozen, slushy mud.  Good luck with that!
	GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = You monitor the surroundings for an extended period of time. You realize that Ciro avoids the horizon and that the time of day does not change.
	GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = As you were coming in to land you swear you just saw a shark attacking a boat right off the coast...
	GaelSrfLandedUakoraShores = Swirlieeeessssss.....
	GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = The mixed colors of Pilgia makes you wonder if the KSC guys would mind you using the science cam for some selfies.
	GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = Eucria is beautiful, flat, colorful, easy to land on and inviting.  Everything any good pilot looks for in a landing strip.
	GaelSrfLandedVolcano = Someone grumbles about the volcano waking. You politely express your disinterest in that.
	GaelSrfLandedMountains = This landing was pretty scary. Let's not do this again...
	GaelSrfLandedHighlands = In the highlands, kerbals are Real Kerbals but sheep are nervous.
	GaelSrfLandedMidlands = You often wonder if living in the Midlands would be equivalent to the suburbs.  It just seems so...average.
	GaelSrfLandedLowlands = You find that landing here rather than on a runway is much easier. You wonder why that is.
	GaelSrfLandedReefs = Any landing you can walk away from is a good one. Here, though, is going to be a very tedious walk...if it's even possible to step away from the beauty of this place.
	GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = After coming down from altitude you find this location to be a perfect vacation spot and make note of a nice piece of lakefront property while you're here...
	GaelSrfLandedWater = Wait...isn't this supposed to SPLASHED in water?  What's with the landing?
	GaelSrfSplashed = The water's surface makes it hard to see down into it, but everyone agrees there's more than meets the eye.
	GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = Now that you've splashed down in the minor shores you begin to get nervous about those stories of giant sharks right off the coast.
	GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = It's quite pleasing to see the geology and its radiant colors through the tint of the shallow water.
	GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = Different than Uakora or Eucria, the colors of the corals of Pilgia makes you want to fingerpaint.
	GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = Eucria has its own personality like the other minor shores of Gael.  She happens to be single, green, loves rockets and wants to find a strong kerbal too...oh wrong magazine.
	GaelSrfSplashedReefs = Crashing and splashing just gotta whole lot better. Everyone becomes captivated by the scenery.
	GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = Look! ...Kritters!
	GaelSrfSplashedWater = You take a brief dive down several meters and your sight is graced by flowery things and wriggly things passing by.
	
	IotaInSpaceHigh = Pity that the ship's onboard imaging tools don't allow for Super-Ultra HD. Otherwise every pixel would be tasty.
	IotaInSpaceLow = From this altitude it's easy to percieve an immeasurable load of tender sugary treat below.
	IotaSrfLandedSkids = Dust raises and the legs/wheels sink gently in. An awesome find, but does it come with awesome taste?
	IotaSrfLandedHighlands = A mild pillow-like sensation on landing is noted. Maybe the surface here is indeed similar to cotton-candy.
	IotaSrfLandedMidlands = The landing is particularly soft and the immediate area is dark. It's okay, though, darker edibles tend to have more to them which is always good.
	IotaSrfLandedLowlands = Touchdown! Everything seems nominal. Now where are the giant shovels? Mission Control is waiting for a piece of this as badly as you are.
	IotaSrfLandedDroops = The surface cracks gently, and around the crack glimmers appear. Is this some kind of sparkly crystal delight?
	
	CetiInspaceHigh = Captain's log: We have entered naked-eye range of the moon. It's pinkish brown, and rippled...and looks partially digested. End log.
	CetiInSpaceLow = As the terrain darkens and cycles colors, so too does your attention span.
	CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = A landing worthy of a wide smile and a good few ribbons. You hope the Final Frontier system is recording this for when you return.
	CetiSrfLandedHighlands = You're reminded in many ways of the highlands of Gael.  Minus the breathable atmosphere, pleasant temperatures and sheep being chased by kerbals in kilts.
	CetiSrfLandedMidlands = Luckily being landed in this region allows you to temporarily put the rest of Ceti out of your mind as you gaze across the least digested landscape of this moon.
	CetiSrfLandedLowlands = Why is it this color??? Just... Why?!
	CetiSrfLandedPoles = The landing gear is slow to spring back after touchdown...kind of like when you stick your finger into the cake frosting.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
	default = Before departing please be sure your seat backs and tray tables are forward and pick up any trash around your area.
	GaelInSpaceHigh = You oogle Gael. The view is fantabulous. But now she considers you a pervert.
	GaelInSpaceLowTundra = When you make comments in your report about the dismal tundra region Gael asks you to try being cold, distant and barren and see just how far you get in life.
	GaelInSpaceLowIceCaps = When you make a note about the light, white covering on the caps of Gael she gets irritated and berates you over age discrimination.
	GaelInSpaceLowMinorShores = These shores are so tiny and beautiful - perfect in every way.  Gael accepts your compliment gracefully...for once.
	GaelInSpaceLowUakoraShores = It would be difficult to find a more strikingly beautiful place than the Uakora Shores and Gael knows it.  You note the conceit present everywhere in the environment.
	GaelInSpaceLowPligiaShores = You wish you had binoculars. It would be cool to try to spot the KSC with them.
	GaelInSpaceLowEucriaShores = The Eucria Shore flew by so fast you barely had time to see them. Almost like Gael just flashed you intentionally to give you just a quick peak at her beauty.
	GaelInSpaceLowVolcano = You wonder if Gael would be insulted if you suggested to the geologists they try to come up with some sort of geologic bleamish cream to remove it...
	GaelInSpaceLowMountains = The mountains don't like quite so threatening from this altitude.  From here you feel perfectly comfortable sticking your tongue out at them and notating it in the report.
	GaelInSpaceLowHighlands = MUST RESIST! CAAannn't....What do you call a highlands kerbal with a sheep under both arms?  A pimp.  Mission Control is not pleased with your report.
	GaelInSpaceLowMidlands = The midlands are really no more interesting from here than they were at the surface.  Now is a great time to play with your jetpack thrusters. Do it!
	GaelInSpaceLowLowlands = It's amazing how wide and flat the wide flat spaces of the lowlands appear from low orbit.  It just so...wide...and flat.
	GaelInSpaceLowReefs = From a low orbit the colors of the coral reefs along the coast weave into intricate colors and lovely swirlies.  That is a scientific term by the way...swirlies.
	GaelInSpaceLowInlandWater = As you pass over the recorded coordinates of the inland waterways you begin daydreaming of your last vacation with that kerbal from...WAIT SCIENCE!
	GaelInSpaceLowWater = THIS!!!!  THIS IS THE ULTIMATE HIGH DIVE!  Who wants to go first?
	GaelFlyingHigh = If you suspected your stupidity meter had broken this just proves you were accurate in your suspicions.
	GaelFlyingLowTundra = You thought flying would improve the view of this dismal area of the planet.  You were wrong and you let your displeasure shine through in your report.
	GaelFlyingLowIceCaps = Too much fluffy white stuff. Can't see.
	GaelFlyingLowMinorShores = Hanging on for dear life over the minor shores and praying there aren't any sharks looking hungrily up at you makes it difficult to write your report.
	GaelFlyingLowUakoraShores = The alluring shores of the Uakora region beckon you like a kerbal seen through beer goggles.  Don't make the mistake of thinking Gael is inviting you in...you'll just get slapped.
	GaelFlyingLowPligiaShores = Until you checked your notes you weren't sure you actually made any as you flew past the Pilgia Shores.  The beauty of the region nearly distracted you into missing it.
	GaelFlyingLowEucriaShores = You were prepared this time.  As you pass into the area around Eucria you frantically begin recording your notes as you cling to the outside of your craft.
	GaelFlyingLowVolcano = You know...hanging around on the outside of a craft while flying over a volcano is a good way to get removed permanently from the flight rotation.
	GaelFlyingLowMountains = You explode with Adrenaline, just like your ship explodes with Surface.
	GaelFlyingLowHighlands = You must be from the highlands if you're willing to hang on to the outside of a craft just to take a look at it as you fly over.
	GaelFlyingLowMidlands = The midlands are so boring that even hanging on to the outside of a craft in mid-flight isn't enough to get you excited about being here.
	GaelFlyingLowLowlands = The wide, flat spaces of the lowlands calls to your landing gear.  Unfortunate for you that you're hanging onto the outside of the craft...
	GaelFlyingLowReefs = You thought hanging on to the outside of your craft in flight would be an excellent way to find a safe place to land on the reefs until your grip started slipping.  You leave that bit out of your report.
	GaelFlyingLowInlandWater = You make some random notes about the inland waterways as you frantically try getting some aerials of lakefront property you're interested in purchasing.
	GaelFlyingLowWater = The wind whips the waves below you into white caps as it also frantically stuggles to yank you from your tenuous hold on the craft's exterior.
	GaelSrfLandedTundra = Your apetite for this climate is particularly low. You fill your report with both objective analysis and personal displeasure.
	GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = It's cold and mushy out here. Let's make snow angels and a snow-kerbal.
	GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = Try as you might, you can't help but constantly eye the water's edge looking for the tail-tale sign...
	GaelSrfLandedUakoraShores = This portion of terrain is really nice. You wonder if Mission Control will let you strip down and take five.
	GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = It's more beautiful here than anywhere else... In the eyes of a kerbal, anyway, who might never see high orbit.
	GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = You determine that it may be somewhat hazardous to tread here in a spacesuit.
	GaelSrfLandedVolcano = Standing here on the face of the massive geological zit you can't help but wonder if you squeezed just right...
	GaelSrfLandedMountains = You declare yourself King Of The Hill.
	GaelSrfLandedHighlands = You utter things in a Scottish accent, then you log them, then it's not as awesome anymore.
	GaelSrfLandedMidlands = Welcome to Kurburbia!
	GaelSrfLandedLowlands = "Did anyone pack bacon or eggs?" You ask as you get this brilliant idea for an experiment.
	GaelSrfLandedReefs = It's quite pleasing to stand here and gaze at the highly colorful scenery. You begin to write elaborate notes.
	GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = Ok.  So here we go again.  Landed.  Water.  LANDED!?
	GaelSrfLandedWater = Ok.  So here we go again.  Landed.  Water.  LANDED!?
	GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = 1...2...3...4...5...6...you stop counting.  Numerous fins are cicling your craft and you can see vicious rows of teeth grinning up at you from just below the water's surface.
	GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = Well now you've done it.  You've forced your way into Gael's Uakora Shores and she is not pleased.  Many crabs come out to greet you as you exit the vehicle.
	GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = You make a much nicer entry and landing in the waters of Pilgia and Gael rewards you for your gentleness with beautiful science.
	GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = The jagged reefs of Eucria jut up out of the water all around you.  Frankly you're amazed you landed without damaging something on the craft.
	GaelSrfSplashedReefs = You see lots of land right under you, and several little things floating about; some obviously alive, others' not obviously alive.
	GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = It's like being in space but really wet and tedious to turn and move.
	GaelSrfSplashedWater = The water waves at you... Ba dum tiss.

	IotaInSpaceHigh = You extend an arm and point at the biome, calling it out by visually familiar snacks rather than by aproper name.
	IotaInSpaceLowSkids = Dust bowl.  You've been informed by the KSC to expect large amounts of dust from this region and from space the depressed region make you think of a bowl.  The scientists should love that analysis.
	IotaInSpaceLowHighlands = You imagine a vast field of cotton candy could appear the same as the geographic region below you.  You estimate there could be several trillion tons of the sweet sticky down there!
	IotaInSpaceLowMidlands = The dark blotches representing the Midlands seem like the tastiest part, not necesarily of candy. You're tempted to have your vessel immediately descend to confirm this.
	IotaInSpaceLowLowlands = You discern a sort of glaze effect on the surface below. It reminds you of juice that has begun to freeze solid.
	IotaInSpaceLowDroops = Your eyes traverse the length of the Droops and linger rather long at it. But then you look away remembering that Gael took offense to the same thing.
	IotaSrfLandedSkids = More loose dust greets you than anywhere else on Iota. You make a note to suggest R&D install windshield wipers on helmets.
	IotaSrfLandedHighlands = Your feet sink into the mushy ground. For an instant you fear for your life. Afterwards, you ask if the parlour has something like this.
	IotaSrfLandedMidlands = A feeling of guilt overcomes you as you set foot on what might possibly indeed be food. Who walks on food, anyway?
	IotaSrfLandedLowlands = You find that the ground resembles bread.
	IotaSrfLandedDroops = The crystalline dark treat goodness doesn't get any better, any closer than this! Oh wait. Yes it does.

	CetiInspaceHigh = In space... no one can hear you puke.
	CetiInSpaceLowPlateaus = You find excitement in the presence of flat areas on this moon. And then everyone else follows suit when they read this later.
	CetiInSpaceLowHighlands = Someone, somewhere, is cracking a stale Highlander joke... This time it's not you.
	CetiInSpaceLowMidlands = The low altitude over the midlands is one of the better views you have since it dominates your field of view obscuring the more digested regions of the moon and allowing you a brief respite.
	CetiInSpaceLowLowlands = Fond memories, this view will not make.
	CetiInSpaceLowPoles = You find it really hard to tell whether that brown stuff is good to eat or good to recycle or good fertilizer.
	CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = The almost perfectly flat surface of the plateaus causes much joy and celebration amongst the scientists and engineers of the KSC and you've already begun hearing the rumblings of construction plans.
	CetiSrfLandedHighlands = Kerbals from the Highlands of Gael sent along their version of a space kilt for your EVA.  Unfortunately it was unusable as they forgot to include the air tight underwear needed to survive without atmosphere.
	CetiSrfLandedMidlands = Although this place looked like cotton candy from afar, remembering what everywhere else looks like bursts your bubble.
	CetiSrfLandedLowlands = Eww... That is all.
	CetiSrfLandedPoles = Several emotions register as you set foot on the mud-like surface.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]:NEEDS[!GPP_Secondary]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
	default = GOO GOO G'JOOB!
	GaelInSpaceHigh = The goo floats about in a perfect sphere. Ripple motions proceed along the Radial vector from the Gael-facing side to the backside. It doesn't get more fascinating than this... Or does it?
	GaelInSpaceLow = The goo floats about leisurely in the form of a perfect tetrahedron until you look at it and then it quickly reverts to a random blob shape almost anticipating your attention.  Spooky.
	GaelFlyingHigh = The goo sprouts wings! ...Then it quickly retracts them.
	GaelFlyingLow = The goo hangs out of its container like a kanine. Droplets escape into the distance but the goo seems not to mind... Maybe you should close the container now.
	GaelSrfLandedTundra = The goo shivers. It must be too familiar with temperate climates.
	GaelSrfLandedIceCaps = The goo takes on the form of a pair of candy canes. You wonder if it's safe to eat them. As if sensing your thoughts the goo first shakes side to side and then assumes it's original form.
	GaelSrfLandedMinorShores = The goo is quite mellow here. It sunbathes and starts to sparkle.
	GaelSrfLandedUakoraShores = The goo reaches out. Maybe it wants to tread on the beach.
	GaelSrfLandedPligiaShores = You see wave patterns on the surface of, and inside of the goo. You grab a radar sensor as quickly as you can but it goes quiescent before you return.
	GaelSrfLandedEucriaShores = You open the canister. There appears to be...another door to open? Oh it's playing chameleon again.
	GaelSrfLandedVolcano = The goo... The goo... The goo is on firrrrre! ...You sing it because, it flows and ripples upward and is colored as though it's actually a fire.
	GaelSrfLandedMountains = The goo forms a hand and points in the direction of KSC. Evidently it didn't care for the landing either.
	GaelSrfLandedHighlands = The goo forms into a sword and shield. It must really be trying to say something.
	GaelSrfLandedMidlands = The goo is particularly idle. Maybe it sleeps.
	GaelSrfLandedLowlands = You catch the goo trying to slither down the side of the ship and escape. You make a special note about its chameleon trait.
	GaelSrfLandedReefs = Somehow the goo is aware of the geology and forms into a sphere with the shape of this reef extruded on the surface.
	GaelSrfLandedInlandWater = The goo finds nothing strange at all about somehow being landed in water.
	GaelSrfLandedWater = The goo finds nothing strange at all about somehow being landed in water.
	GaelSrfSplashedMinorShores = A large fin shape forms on the surface of the goo and begins moving in a circular motion.
	GaelSrfSplashedUakoraShores = Somehow, someway the goo actually manages to appear more lovely here than anywhere else.  This is truly mystifying.
	GaelSrfSplashedPligiaShores = The goo smoothes out and forms a shape of a serene coastline with lapping waves. The goo is pleased.
	GaelSrfSplashedEucriaShores = You barely spot the goo as it camoflagues itself again within the container.  Apparently the goo feels playful in the Eucria region.
	GaelSrfSplashedReefs = The goo forms into a chunk of coral, with hard, sparkly bits and squiggly ripples very prominent about it.
	GaelSrfSplashedInlandWater = The goo starts expanding at a slow and constant pace. Then you quickly close the canister and hope the quite possibly chemical process starves and stops.
	GaelSrfSplashedWater = The goo herds itself to the ceiling of the canister and develops a solid exterior. It must have a serious bias against salt water.
	
	IotaInSpaceHigh = The goo seems puffy. Mmm... Mystery Puffs. Wait, what are you thinking?!
	IotaInSpaceLow = The goo reaches out at the surface. It must have as much yearning for the candy moon Iota as you have.
	IotaSrfLandedSkids =
	IotaSrfLandedHighlands = The goo attempts to ooze down the side of the device but you wave your finger at it and it withdraws like a good boy.
	IotaSrfLandedMidlands = The goo leans back within its container. It must be upset with no current opportunity to escape and taste Iota first.
	IotaSrfLandedLowlands = The goo forms into a hammer. It must want you to strike the surface and unwittingly grant it the honor of First Taste.
	IotaSrfLandedDroops = The goo simply hangs from its container. It may be unsure whether this part of the moon is actually candy.
	
	CetiInspaceHigh = The goo mimics the contours of Ceti's surface. Maybe it knows you don't like it.
	CetiInSpaceLow = The goo writhes and shivers. It may be a farfetched idea but maybe the goo is also very unhappy to be here.
	CetiSrfLandedPlateaus = You observe one wave-like motion on the goo's surface, as though a pebble splashed down. The goo must be in some sort of contented state.
	CetiSrfLandedHighlands = The goo once again mimics the ground detail. It's an amusing sight as this biome is a palatable one.
	CetiSrfLandedMidlands = You see wave motions in the goo's surface. You log this as one of the most random or cryptic responses ever observed from this kooky stuff.
	CetiSrfLandedLowlands = The goo once again forms a protruding arrow pointing at Gael. You figure the goo to be quite childish.
	CetiSrfLandedPoles = The goo gives no discernable reaction. It must have mixed emotions and feel as conflicted about the polar surface as you do.
