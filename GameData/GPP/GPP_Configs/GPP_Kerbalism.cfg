  @RESULTS

  {
	CiroSrfLanded = Ummmm... No.
	CiroFlyingLow = Son of Kraken!
	CiroFlyingHigh = At this point you really cannot distinguish ionization from sheer thermal induction.
	CiroInSpaceLow = You must be reenacting the Sunshine (2007) movie if you're still alive to read this!
	CiroInSpaceHigh = The solar wind burns more now, unmitigated by the intervention of any planet.
	
	IcarusSrfLanded = Geiger attempts to chill, showing no radiation presence, but he's still cooking just as anything and anyone right now.
	IcarusInSpaceLow = The gamma levels subside. You find this so peculiar, but you take relief in the hope that you may not have to deal with it as well as the heat if you land.
	IcarusInSpaceHigh = You find a modest and consistent flow of gamma rays coming from the planet rather than the star. Fascinating!
	
	ThaliaSrfLanded = You detect a high amount of ambient radiation or at least confirm the presence of a lot of radioactive material within the crust. 
	ThaliaInSpaceLow = The compact magnetosphere shows more vivdly. Where you expect the radiation curve to dial down compared to Gael, it does not, and does so closer to the surface.
	ThaliaInSpaceHigh = Does it get any scarier here, up close? You find a misshapened magnetic field after just beginning to come to terms with the unexplained ambient heat.
	
	EtaSrfLanded = Geiger is chill. Eta is as chill while landed as while space.
	EtaInSpaceLow = Nope. Nothing yet. You steele yourself with the anticipation that Eta might surprise with something deadly.
	EtaInSpaceHigh = It astounds you that this moon dances right outside of a far larger deadly thing than the eyes can measure. Anyway it seems pretty safe here so break out the snacks!
	
	NivenSrfLanded = It's safe to put away the foil wrappings but it's still a bad idea to strip down and step outside.
	NivenFlyingLow = Geiger says it's safe to turn off the red lights now.
	NivenFlyingHigh = Some space radiation persists here!
	NivenInSpaceLow = Some deep analysis confirms that this planet's own radiation field is eroding its atmosphere!
	NivenInSpaceHigh = The device registers a very unique radiation pattern with this planet. It's safe to assume from the look of things that the pattern is tied to the atmosphere.
	
	GaelSrfLanded = Geiger sleeps. Though it may wiggle its toes if used near a concentration of Uraninite.
	GaelFlyingLow = The device is enjoying the ride as much as you are. It forgets to be alert and registers nothing.
	GaelFlyingHigh = The needle goes up but you wonder if it's measuring radiation or speed.
	GaelInSpaceLow = You encounter powerful toroidal formations of deadly ionizing particles and wonder absolutely why is this here? ...And can engines be developed around them in the near future(tm)?
	GaelInSpaceHigh = The space radiation is still very strong out here. It seems deterring... What if everywhere is like this?
	
	IotaSrfLanded = The Geiger still rests. it's celebration time!
	IotaInSpaceLow = It continues to appear very safe in Iotian space. Prepare the shovels. Droops Candy is clearly safe to eat.
	IotaInSpaceHigh = The needle barely budges. That's a nice but dull entry for the logs.
	
	CetiSrfLanded = Your suit ensures that you feel nothing...but it's just a little warm here.
	CetiInSpaceLow = Since it twitched it has very steadily, very slowly risen. Ceti's looks aren't the only displeasing thing about it anymore.
	CetiInSpaceHigh = The needle twitches. Geiger must have been slightly jarred by the sight of the moon.
	
	TellumoSrfLanded = What's hot and cold at the same time? ....Tellumo.
	TellumoFlyingLow = Unlike at Gael the needle still holds a very modest position above zero. Well dang, imagine what the surface is like.
	TellumoFlyingHigh = The atmosphere, it burns! Forget the radioactive stuff!
	TellumoInSpaceLow = The geiger pulls a high note. It's twice as bad here as around Gael!
	TellumoInSpaceHigh = That same powerful irradiance from Gael meets you again. It makes you wonder if the ice is radioactive.
	
	LiliSrfLanded = If ever you wanted to stick a bulb in a potato and watch it light up, now is the time!
	LiliInSpaceLow = Lili's kinda... hot. Rimshot.
	LiliInSpaceHigh = It's reasonably strong out here. Well it makes sense, there's no way this infant world can shield itself.
	
	GratianSrfLanded = The needle rises. Depending on the mission goal you picked a good place to land...or not...
	GratianFlyingLow = Red dust heavily gathers on the face of the instrument but doesn't block the data flow... yet.
	GratianFlyingHigh = The sensors burn slightly but not from cosmic stuff.
	GratianInSpaceLow = Spices themselves are kind of like deadly ionizing material. It just depends on where it gets to and if you can resist it long enough. That said, there's nothing to worry about yet plenty to write about the actual weird readouts here. 
	GratianInSpaceHigh = If we ever have to turn on the red lights we can save some battery and just angle the windows at Gratian. That said, it's perfctly safe to roll up the Aluminum.
	
	GeminusSrfLanded = The lower you go the more the needle inches up. You wonder what the composition of the darker surface material is and can't discern whether Geminus is absorbing or emitting.
	GeminusInSpaceLow = The irradiance is modest but clearly present. You wonder if it intervened in any way with Geminus' marvelous geography.
	GeminusInSpaceHigh = Gratian's irregular field carries over here. You detect an unhampered stream of charged particles flowing past this moon and its parent.
