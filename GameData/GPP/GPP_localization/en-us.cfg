		#LOC_GPP_agents_description = The Gaelean Historians Collective is a timeless non-profit organzation whose purpose has been to bring recognition to, and chronicle world firsts of all sorts. They tend to be fully able to financially encourage and reward individuals to do, and who have done the same. The local corporations attempt to bank on this as well, and fortunately for them, are not exempt from earning a signature in their receipt books, and a page in the Kuinness World Book of Records.

		//GPP/GPP_Configs/GPP_Kerbalism.cfg
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroSrfLanded = Ummmm... No.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroFlyingLow = Son of Kraken!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroFlyingHigh = At this point you really cannot distinguish ionization from sheer thermal induction.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroInSpaceLow = You must be reenacting the Sunshine (2007) movie if you're still alive to read this!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CiroInSpaceHigh = The solar wind burns more now, unmitigated by the intervention of any planet.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IcarusSrfLanded = Geiger attempts to chill, showing no radiation presence, but he's still cooking just as anything and anyone right now.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IcarusInSpaceLow = The gamma levels subside. You find this so peculiar, but you take relief in the hope that you may not have to deal with it as well as the heat if you land.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IcarusInSpaceHigh = You find a modest and consistent flow of gamma rays coming from the planet rather than the star. Fascinating!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ThaliaSrfLanded = You detect a high amount of ambient radiation or at least confirm the presence of a lot of radioactive material within the crust.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ThaliaInSpaceLow = The compact magnetosphere shows more vivdly. Where you expect the radiation curve to dial down compared to Gael, it does not, and does so closer to the surface.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ThaliaInSpaceHigh = Does it get any scarier here, up close? You find a misshapened magnetic field after just beginning to come to terms with the unexplained and blistering ambient heat.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_EtaSrfLanded = Geiger is chill. Eta is as chill while landed as while space.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_EtaInSpaceLow = Nope. Nothing yet. You steele yourself with the anticipation that Eta might surprise with something deadly.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_EtaInSpaceHigh = It astounds you that this moon dances right outside of a far larger deadly thing than the eyes can measure. Anyway it seems pretty safe here so break out the snacks!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenSrfLanded = It's safe to put away the foil wrappings but it's still a bad idea to strip down and step outside.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenFlyingLow = Geiger says it's safe to turn off the red lights now.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenFlyingHigh = Some space radiation persists here!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenInSpaceLow = Some deep analysis confirms that this planet's own radiation field is eroding its atmosphere!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NivenInSpaceHigh = The device registers a very unique radiation pattern with this planet. It's safe to assume from the look of things that the pattern is tied to the atmosphere.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelSrfLanded = Geiger sleeps. Though it may wiggle its toes if used near a concentration of Uraninite.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelFlyingLow = The device is enjoying the ride as much as you are. It forgets to be alert and registers nothing.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelFlyingHigh = The needle goes up but you wonder if it's measuring radiation or speed.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelInSpaceLow = You encounter powerful toroidal formations of deadly ionizing particles and wonder absolutely why is this here? ...And can engines be developed around them in the near future(tm)?
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaelInSpaceHigh = The space radiation is still very strong out here. It seems deterring... What if everywhere is like this?
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IotaSrfLanded = The Geiger still rests. it's celebration time!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IotaInSpaceLow = It continues to appear very safe in Iotian space. Prepare the shovels. Droops Candy is clearly safe to eat.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_IotaInSpaceHigh = The needle barely budges. That's a nice but dull entry for the logs.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CetiSrfLanded = Your suit ensures that you feel nothing...but it's just a little warm here.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CetiInSpaceLow = Since it twitched it has very steadily, very slowly risen. Ceti's looks aren't the only displeasing thing about it anymore.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CetiInSpaceHigh = The needle twitches. Geiger must have been slightly jarred by the sight of the moon.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoSrfLanded = What's hot and cold at the same time? ....Tellumo.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoFlyingLow = Unlike at Gael the needle still holds a very modest position above zero. Well dang, imagine what the surface is like.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoFlyingHigh = The atmosphere, it burns! Forget the radioactive stuff!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoInSpaceLow = The geiger pulls a high note. It's twice as bad here as around Gael!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TellumoInSpaceHigh = That same powerful irradiance from Gael meets you again. It makes you wonder if the ice is radioactive.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LiliSrfLanded = If ever you wanted to stick a bulb in a potato and watch it light up, now is the time!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LiliInSpaceLow = Lili's kinda... hot. Rimshot.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LiliInSpaceHigh = It's reasonably strong out here. Well it makes sense, there's no way this infant world can shield itself.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianSrfLanded = The needle rises. Depending on the mission goal you picked a good place to land...or not...
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianFlyingLow = Red dust heavily gathers on the face of the instrument but doesn't block the data flow... yet.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianFlyingHigh = The sensors burn slightly but not from cosmic stuff.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianInSpaceLow = Spices themselves are kind of like deadly ionizing material. It just depends on where it gets to and if you can resist it long enough. That said, there's nothing to worry about yet plenty to write about the actual weird readouts here.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GratianInSpaceHigh = If we ever have to turn on the red lights we can save some battery and just angle the windows at Gratian. That said, it's perfctly safe to roll up the Aluminum.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GeminusSrfLanded = The lower you go the more the needle inches up. You wonder what the composition of the darker surface material is and can't discern whether Geminus is absorbing or emitting.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GeminusInSpaceLow = The irradiance is modest but clearly present. You wonder if it intervened in any way with Geminus' marvelous geography.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GeminusInSpaceHigh = Gratian's irregular field carries over here. You detect an unhampered stream of charged particles flowing past this moon and its parent.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoFlyingLow = Your ship is as yellow and white as the planet. Be happy. You've attained your membership in the yellow bodies club.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoFlyingHigh = Although you may be burning alive at this point, the unique irradiance pattern is very bold and is consistent with Otho's distance from Ciro.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoInSpaceLow = According to the geiger, it absolutely burns just to be here! Is this the weight of Otho's gaze? You find a window and carefully look out to see if its eye is indeed positioned in your general direction.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_OthoInSpaceHigh = The readings seem particularly high here, higher than even at the largest gas giant. Why this is, warrants a direct run to the nearest science lab.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusSrfLanded = You forget that there is a potential equal danger to being here as under any other foreign skies. Apart from an apparent lack of water, this place seems quite inviting. The geiger's lack of response seems to finally confirm this.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusFlyingLow = The place gets as yellow and orange as anywhere will ever get. The instrument barely reacts so maybe the extreme color bias is the only actual threat to exposed sensory bits.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusFlyingHigh = The geiger doesn't count... The atmosphere must help quite a lot to mitigate Otho's radiation.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusInSpaceLow = As you approach you think more about what kind of reading you will find.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_AugustusInSpaceHigh = You would think that maybe something was up, here, given the strong color, but surprise! It seems very safe.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HephaestusSrfLanded = The needle barely jumps but that means you can! Hephaestus does very well to deflect cosmic radiation, it seems!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HephaestusInSpaceLow = The needle flops loosely indicating the device has become defective. You consider searching here for metal in case some other bits of technology decide to show their wear.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HephaestusInSpaceHigh = The sharp transition from the radiation value outside this moon's SOI to 0 astounds you. There must be something here quite worth finding and mining the science out of.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_JannahSrfLanded = The device rests again. Either it's passed out from fear or the battery is spoiled.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_JannahInSpaceLow = The radiation 'down here' doesn't seem as scary or suspicious as up high.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_JannahInSpaceHigh = You find a very suspicious cavity in the radiation belt here. To your surprise it's geosynchronous with that equally suspicious cavity in the face of the moon!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussFlyingLow = The glass cracks.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussFlyingHigh = You're able to separate ionizing radiation from scalding heat. Congratulations!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussInSpaceLow = Can you hear it? that's the sound of Van Allen Kerman's ghost howling.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GaussInSpaceHigh = The needle jitters. You are extremely far but the immediate response seems like you're extremely near.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LokiSrfLanded = The Geiger is silent. It may be terrified after what happened on the way down.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LokiInSpaceLow = The needle sharply movs and jitters about. It's nearly enough to cause a panic but it stops as quickly as it started. Was it yet another genuine anomaly or is this moon living up to its name?
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LokiInSpaceHigh = The geiger gives tiny but rhytmic readings. The sine waves almost resemble a comedic villain laughing.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusSrfLanded = There seems to be some alpha decay even way down here. Since Catullus is a borderline gas planet it all works out.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusFlyingLow = There's so much purple you'd think the atmosphere itself mutated from exposure to itself.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusFlyingHigh = The atmosphere is tangy with a weak saturation of radiation. Compared to Gael it's a small deal.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusInSpaceLow = The Geiger coasts on higher numbers. You know that stuff is about to get real.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_CatullusInSpaceHigh = Radiation level is rather high. Catullus clearly has plenty to be scared about.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissSrfLanded = The barometer no longer distracts you, but its own readout on landing, lingering in your mind, does continue to distract.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissFlyingLow = Your attention is torn between reading this device and staring at the barometer.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissFlyingHigh = The device still dos not signal any presence of harmful radiation. You wonder again if it's broken.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissInSpaceLow = The Geiger rests.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_TarsissInSpaceHigh = Radiation level is nill. You suspect that Tarsiss has its own healthy magnetosphere.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroFlyingLow = Radiation levels just keep climbing. While you need more than just Shielding in order to survive long enough to escape from here, the readings make for epic science and an epic story to tell the grandkids.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroFlyingHigh = Nero's heartbeat is very evident. This planet is quite alive. Look at all those digits on the screen! Yeah, those on the thermometer too!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroInSpaceLow = The needles fly up and dance about very lively, though not as much as it did at Otho.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NeroInSpaceHigh = You detect a spike. Even at the edge of this immense SOI a modest amount is registered and displayed by the Geiger. The king indeed throws his weight around.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianSrfLanded = The Geiger is frozen and does not respond.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianFlyingLow = You ponder whether possibly, any radiation at this point may be a sign of proximity to Nero's heavenly Snack Bar.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianFlyingHigh = There's still no radiation, but you do confirm the coldness as the cockpit glass glazes over.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianInSpaceLow = You know, this moon looks like it's made of ice. Maybe it's so cold that alpha decay is halted.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HadrianInSpaceHigh = There's no radiation here... But there's a lot of photo opportunity.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NarisseSrfLanded = No evidence of radiation still. Now if Narisse was indeed an edible celestial there'd be no fear of getting epic indigestion.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NarisseInSpaceLow = Still nothing... But still a worthy entry for the archives.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_NarisseInSpaceHigh = You detect nothing; an appropriate expctation of a moon that's barely there.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MuseSrfLanded = The readings are nominal. This makes an okay entry to the logs.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MuseInSpaceLow = You're able to focus this time and you record the readings, which are technically none.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MuseInSpaceHigh = You find yourself thinking a lot of things. Unfortunately none of these include the actual readout of the Geiger, but fortunately it wouldn't have mattered.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MinonaSrfLanded = You experience a fair bit of disllusionment. Landed, the radiance seems to vanish. The Geiger would smirk about now if it was alive...like the Mystery Goo.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MinonaInSpaceLow = Her radiance increases as you get closer. The sentiment is not mutual, however, as the Geiger shows no response whatsoever.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_MinonaInSpaceHigh = You find Minona particularly radiant. Maybe not in a harmful way like you expect, but still.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxSrfLanded = The Geiger rests. Again...
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxFlyingLow = You get no response from the Geiger. It brings some comfort in that the climate here doesn't add to the amount of natural hazards.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxFlyingHigh = The needle keeps jittering. It's hard to tell whether it's colder in space, or in this sky, or whether the sky is surprisingly radioactive.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxInSpaceLow = The Geiger jitters slightly. You wonder if there's an erratic property here or even the machinefeels cold.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_HoxInSpaceHigh = The ambient radiation levels don't change. This is both a good sign anda bad one.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ArgoSrfLanded = The Geiger continues to show no interesting numbers. That means one very good thing... The water has one more good reason to pump straight into the ship and drink in a few minutes!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ArgoInSpaceLow = The colors and textures distract you from reading the device. When you remember to do so, apparently the values declare that it's completely safe.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_ArgoInSpaceHigh = No interesting or emphasized numbers arise. It's a good thing too, as that would show Argo to actually be just another deadly siren in space.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LetoSrfLanded = Radiation levels are very minor and noteworthy to the device. This anomalous turnout prompts the use of more science experiments.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LetoInSpaceLow = The readings are soft but erratic and noisy, indicating the presence of a peculiar factor, but not indicating the presence of a clear danger.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_LetoInSpaceHigh = Readings are as average as they get, however, knowing how far you are from Gael, you anticipate quite a different experience once you go far enough beyond this planetoid.
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusSrfLanded = The radiation level is over 9000 times 9000!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusFlyingLow = Son of True Kraken!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusFlyingHigh = The Geiger screams in absolute terror and agony!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusInSpaceLow = The radiation levels are surprisingly strong here. So much of it is in InfraRed rather than in UltraViolet and Gamma. Now this is science!
		#LOC_GPP_KerbalismGeiger_GrannusInSpaceHigh = After discovering the increased plights of the interstellar medium, the device's numbers coast at a lower and steady nominal, but still higher than within Ciro's heliopause. Maybe the differences in wavelengths and saturation are a reflection of Grannus' sheer age.

		//GPP/GPP_Configs/GPP_LaunchSites.cfg (also used in GPP_RemoteTech.cfg)
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name1 = KSC Main
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description1 = The main location of Gael's KSC. It sits upon a tiny isle adjacent to a crown-like mountain range at the edge of its mainland, and which includes a volcano.
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name2 = Point Spetses
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description2 = A peninsula like location that protrudes Westward and and is very near to the frosty Tundra. It's ramp-like appearance while viewed from Mesosphere can be quite invigorating in the eyes of inbound pilots.
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name3 = Kerbonaut's Hope
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description3 = The KSC is positioned near a natural bridge between a great lake in the North, and ocean.
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name4 = Northern Valley
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description4 = At this location the KSC occupies a midland patch near a valley that once was dry but has become a great lake. This lake is not in sight from the KSC, however. Launch off the runway here and be prepared for a beautiful sight.
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name5 = Rook's Glory
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description5 = An equatorial, seaside location. This is the most forgiving option for players transitioning from the Kerbin experience.
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name6 = Southern Site
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description6 = Southern Site is an alternate launch site.
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name7 = DomRok
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description7 = DomRok is a large island, and the highest point thereof, in the Mid-West with nearly equal and opposite inclination to the default location. KSC becomes the Island Base.
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_name8 = Broken Arrow
		#LOC_GPP_SpaceCenters_description8 = In the early years of rocketry, Broken Arrow was a state-of-the-art launchsite. Today, it is used mostly as a bridge to avoid comms black out between Rooks Glory and KSC Main, and as an occasional launch site for the lucky enthusiast that gets clearance to launch.
