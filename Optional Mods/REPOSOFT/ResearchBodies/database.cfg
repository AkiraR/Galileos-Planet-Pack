		Icarus = The likes of a spherical oyster or other mollusk is found in the sky. Mmm, oysters... Oh, wait, we're looking for planets. Let's name it Icarus!
		Thalia = Holy-- what in the kraken?! It's horrible! It's terrifying!!! The obeservatory team evacuates. Thalia winks in satifaction.
		Eta = A twinkling white glimmer emerges from behind the big, scary red glimmer. Eta, the fairest moon of all graces the archives.
		Niven = Something about that big bright orange inspires sweets. The observatory team bets it will be sweet to go there. Pack extra ice, guys! We're going to Niven!
		Tellumo = Intensity has never intensified like it does right now. With the tiniest of zoom-in, Tellumo's image becomes crystal clear.
		Lili = You find a little sparkle racing around Tellumo, otherwise hiding well in its rings... Is this thing drunk on sugar?
		Gratian = Looks like we found a giant peach, said James B. Kerman.
		Geminus = A white light begins to change direction and move the opposite way, towards a peach colored one. It must be a real gem of a moon; Hello, Geminus!
		Otho = After watching for a solid few minutes the observatory team gathers and meditates. Is this a gas giant or a banana punch giant?
		Augustus = An orange light steals the show. It's confirmed to have a thick atmosphere. Space tourism just went to the next, next level. 
		Hephaestus = Woah. This moon is really small. We didn't expect to find it, honestly but we're glad it is where it is. Now, where's the trail mix?
		Jannah = You see Jannah. But she sees you too and proceeds to flee behind Otho. Is it worth it to chase this moon?
		Gauss = Behind a strong blue light further ahead, the team discovers...another gas giant? Other instruments promptly lock onto the presence of an enormous magnetic field. There's so much of it that a team member names the giant for it. We have ourselves a giant named Gauss.
		Catullus = There's a big purple thing out there... Yes, purple! "Catullus," said Jade J Kerman, a lead scientist who happens by as this discovery occurs. It's as if he was waiting for this moment.
		Loki = "Trololol~Lo'lo'lololo~" Loki sings manically as he dances clear into view and into everyone's memories. for better or for worse.
