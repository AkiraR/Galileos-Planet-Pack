	{
		Icarus = The likes of a spherical oyster or other mollusk is found in the sky. Mmm, oysters... Oh, wait, we're looking for planets. Let's name it Icarus!
		Thalia = Holy-- what in the kraken?! It's horrible! It's terrifying!!! The obeservatory team evacuates. Thalia winks in satifaction.
		Eta = A twinkling white glimmer emerges from behind the big, scary red glimmer. Eta, the fairest moon of all graces the archives.
		Niven = Something about that big bright orange inspires sweets. The observatory team bets it will be sweet to go there. Pack extra ice, guys! We're going to Niven!
		Tellumo = Intensity has never intensified like it does right now. With the tiniest of zoom-in, Tellumo's image becomes crystal clear.
		Lili = You find a little sparkle racing around Tellumo, otherwise hiding well in its rings... Is this thing drunk on sugar?
		Gratian = Looks like we found a giant peach, said James B. Kerman.
		Geminus = A white light begins to change direction and move the opposite way, towards a peach colored one. It must be a real gem of a moon; Hello, Geminus!
		Otho = After watching for a solid few minutes the observatory team gathers and meditates. Is this a gas giant or a banana punch giant?
		Augustus = An orange light steals the show. It's confirmed to have a thick atmosphere. Space tourism just went to the next, next level. 
		Hephaestus = Woah. This moon is really small. We didn't expect to find it, honestly but we're glad it is where it is. Now, where's the trail mix?
		Jannah = You see Jannah. But she sees you too and proceeds to flee behind Otho. Is it worth it to chase this moon?
		Gauss = Behind a strong blue light further ahead, the team discovers...another gas giant? Other instruments promptly lock onto the presence of an enormous magnetic field. There's so much of it that a team member names the giant for it. We have ourselves a giant named Gauss.
		Catullus = There's a big purple thing out there... Yes, purple! "Catullus," said Jade J Kerman, a lead scientist who happens by as this discovery occurs. It's as if he was waiting for this moment.
		Loki = "Trololol~Lo'lo'lololo~" Loki sings manically as he dances clear into view and into everyone's memories. For better or for worse.
		Tarsiss = When you see a little dot next to a big dot of the same color you know it's something. And Tarsiss is that something.
		Nero = The optics confirm a gas giant in the most vast of distances. No words are found to describe it. Nero the great, and his wide, inclined rings cause everyone to drop their jaw or sink to their knees.
		Hadrian = Sensors detect what appears to be a strawberry with whipped cream on top. We elect to name it Hadrian, just in case it is not.
		Minona = Ooooh. Pretty moon. Do you thinkit's Nero's wife or his daughter. Let's ask her. Minona! Hey, Minona!
		Muse = Now, this is the most intriguing thing we've ever found. Look at those ripples! The observatory team finds itself musing for an excessive amount of time over it. Therefore, a poetically inclined kerbal decides to name it Muse.
		Narisse = The one scientist on duty at the time returns from obtaining caramel chocolate snacks. Somehow he spots the tiny Narisse, who looks just like those snacks.... Whoa.
		Hox = You find a pale orange entity near the edge of the telescope's ES range. Is it the farthest one? Who knows. But you do know that its probably an ice planet. Planet Hox.
		Argo = After studying for enough time, that one twinkle moving like the electron in a Hydrogen atom, you finally spot the siren, Argo.
		Leto = Hold up. Is that an ice cream scoop in space??? Oh, it's Leto! But Leto's so far away! Maybe it's indeed an ice cream scoop. Maybe it has sprinkles?
