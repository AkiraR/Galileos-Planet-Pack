		@displayName = Kiro
		@description = Among trillions of other yellow stars Kiro is nothing special, but it's the center of a very inviting system. Many other stars hold celestial bodies like and unlike the ones here... But how many of them are host to perfect planets like Gael and Tellumo, to play and snack outside without spacesuits? And what other bountiful surprises await within its SOI? This is why we have space programs.

		@description = As it turns out Kiro is very far from alone in its little corner of the galaxy. Prancing about even to the edge of its SOI is this angry, lonely dwarf. Is Krannus itself truly lonely and the sole holder of a barren system, or like Kiro, is it hiding a bounty?
