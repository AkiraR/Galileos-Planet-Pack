			description = Among trillions of other yellow stars Ciro is nothing special, but it's indeed smaller and dimmer, making Gael seem a little far and cold. Many of those other stars hold celestial bodies like and unlike the ones here... But how many of them have perfect planets like Gael and Tellumo, to play and snack outside without spacesuits? This is why we have space programs.
