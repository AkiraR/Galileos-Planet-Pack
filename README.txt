Changelog:

**V0.9**

* Flipped KSC Around 180 degrees

* Converted Tellumo to a Laythe template so it wont have KerbNet stations.

* Turned off Scatterer's Ocean Shaders to allow for better performance. If you want to turn them on, you can do so in the main menu scatterer options.


**Known Issues**
 
* Clouds do not show up in main menu very often. Just a small bug with Kopernicus.. not a big deal. Nothing is broken.

* Scatterer does not show in main menu or in tracking station. Again, nothing is broken.

* Mac and Linux Version uses quite a bit of ram (about 3gbs). its either this, or have pinstripey planets and not be able to use this planet pack.. sorry.

* Running game in dx11 causes terrain textures to be striped.
