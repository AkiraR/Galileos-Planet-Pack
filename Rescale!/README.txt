For this to work, you need to install Sigma Dimensions.

Then drop one of the cfgs into your GameData folder. 

I reccommend removing KSC++ when using Sigma Dimensions. 

KNOWN ISSUES: 

* Sigma Dimensions, when used with KSC Switcher and KSC++, causes some issues.
Switching to a new launchsite and returning to the default KSC site later, causes KSC++ statics to be clipping into the ground. It's not game breaking but it is ugly. I reccommend removing KSC++ when using Sigma Dimensions.

ENJOY you resized GPP!
