TO INSTALL:

1. Create a new install of KSP and run once with zero mods. 

2. Install Kopernicus, ModularFlightIntegrator (part of Kopernicus) and ModuleManager.dll within GameData\ and run KSP again. No planet mod works without these. They are also not included in this package. If, however, you're not creating a new install then backup and remove your saves. Any existing playthrough will be broken.

3. Install GPP and ensure that KSP always launches in 64-bit (KSP_x64.exe on Windows). Your PC should have no less than 8GB RAM.

4. Install any of the remaining bundled mods if they suit you: KSC Switcher, Scatterer, TextureReplacer, Kerbal Konstructs with KSC++, Final Frontier.

**Recommended mods with support for GPP**
* Distant Objects Enhancemnts 
* PlanetShine
* Kerbalism
* Strategia
* RemoteTech
* Mechjeb
* Research Bodies
* Waypoint Manager
* Decal Stickers

# Changelog:
## v1.2.0



## Known Issues
 
* Clouds do not show up in main menu. Just a small bug with Kopernicus. not a big deal. Nothing is broken.

* Scatterer does not show in main menu. Again, normal. Nothing is broken.

* Mac and Linux Version uses quite a bit of ram. Its either this, or have pinstripey planets and not be able to use this planet pack. Sorry.

* Running game in dx11 causes terrain textures to be pinstriped.

* Orbit lines jump around when zoomed out to outer planets in map view and tracking station. Its stock bug made more noticeable by Kopernicus

* Sigma Dimensions does not play nice with KSCSwitcher AND KSC++. I recommend you remove KSC++ when using Sigma Dimensions

* Any Decal Stickers parts with stock flags set in them revert to GPP flags on launch or on reload within the SPH/VAB.
