TO INSTALL:

1. Create a new install of KSP and run once with zero mods. 

2. Install Kopernicus, ModularFlightIntegrator (part of Kopernicus) and ModuleManager.dll within GameData\ and run KSP again. No planet mod works without these. They are also not included in this package. If, however, you're not creating a new install then backup and remove your saves. Any existing playthrough will be broken.

3. Install GPP and ensure that KSP always launches in 64-bit (KSP_x64.exe on Windows). Your PC should have no less than 8GB RAM.

4. Install any of the remaining bundled mods if they suit you: KSC Switcher, Scatterer, TextureReplacer, Kerbal Konstructs with KSC++, Final Frontier.

**Recommended mods with support for GPP**
* Distant Objects Enhancemnts 
* PlanetShine
* Kerbalism
* Strategia
* RemoteTech
* Mechjeb
* Research Bodies
* Waypoint Manager
* Decal Stickers

# Changelog:
## v1.2.0

* Support for Scatterer v0.0300 and renamed bundled SVE to GPPVE to cure chronic Stock Visual Confusion.
  
  * Removed Medium SVE/GPPVE option to save on download size. The difference between Medium and High was minimal in-game.

* Reduced the following into MM patches, simplifying things overall and saving more on download size:

  * Distant Object Enhancement; Strategia; Planetshine; Waypoint Manager; Sunflare toggle for whether Scatterer is present or not.
  
* Enabled MechJeb to acknowledge KSC default location.

* KSPedia implementation - With information on all major bodies!

* Catered for new 'big' sticker in Decal Stickers mod.

* Far-reaching body updates:

  * Simplified biome distributions on the noisier of biome maps.
  
  * Optimized color textures to lose excess file size but keep all quality.

  * Adjusted Scaled Space to PQS render height for much smoother transitions.
  
  * Visual updates to Niven!
  
  * Merged Gael and Tellumo cloud layers to consolidate textures.
  
  * Implemented EVE eclipses. ALL bodies recieve eclipses, with and without Scatterer.
  
  * Optimized Nero color and biomes to match ring tilt.
  
  * Added slight tilt to Otho and Gauss.
  
  * Raised Lili's SOI to 40km to un-break Lili Orbital Survey contracts.
  
  * Optimized terrain elevations so KER and the like can honestly tell where sea level is.
  
  * Added anomalies to all bodies, and more PQSMod tweaks to some worlds. This includes fixes for terrain jitter and performance drain, especially at Tellumo.
  
  * Improved texure details even more on some worlds.
  
  * Changed Flight Globals to enable certain provisions and prevent a related issue.

* Added "Career Saver" as the Flight Globals change will cause other issues (specifically: break existing game saves).
  
* Strategia updates.

* Updated deltaV map.

* Full Kerbalism support.

* Gael updates:

  * Lowered KSC island height and made shoreline friendly to enter/exit the ocean. Updated KSC++ and island biomes accordingly.
  
  * Changed Initial Rotation to put sunrise at 01:30 UTC.
  
  * Tuned Semi-major Axis so years are exactly 426.0 days long.
  
  * Renamed the Kerbin World-Firsts Society to Gaelean Historians Collective.
  
  * Minor adjustments to terrain and biome maps.

* Updated Texture Replacer.

* Custom loading screen!

* Other new bells and whistles. Some very small... Some very big.

## Known Issues
 
* Clouds do not show up in main menu. Just a small bug with Kopernicus. not a big deal. Nothing is broken.

* Scatterer does not show in main menu. Again, normal. Nothing is broken.

* Mac and Linux Version uses quite a bit of ram. Its either this, or have pinstripey planets and not be able to use this planet pack. Sorry.

* Running game in dx11 causes terrain textures to be pinstriped.

* Orbit lines jump around when zoomed out to outer planets in map view and tracking station. Its stock bug made more noticeable by Kopernicus

* Sigma Dimensions does not play nice with KSCSwitcher AND KSC++. I recommend you remove KSC++ when using Sigma Dimensions

* Any Decal Stickers parts with stock flags set in them revert to GPP flags on launch or on reload within the SPH/VAB.
