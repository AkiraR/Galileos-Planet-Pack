TO INSTALL:

1. Create a new install of KSP and run once without mods. Then you may install GPP and other mods. Otherwise backup and remove your saves. Any existing campaign that uses the stock planets will be broken.

2. Install the latest version of Kopernicus. Its version must always match the KSP version or it will not work. Do not readily accept KSP game updates as between new KSP release and Kopernicus catch-up you may find things on Gael suddenly bound to a stock planet other than Kerbin.

3. Install GPP like anything else. Do it manually. Due to this mod's level of complexity there will be no CKAN support.

4. In GPP's Optional Mods folder see if there's something for another mod that you use. If there is, copy the GameData folder from inside each one and allow it to overwrite everything. The affected mod needs to already be installed. Kerbal Konstructs with KSC++ is patched and included whole.

5. If you use SVE, EVE,and SVT delete them completely then reinstall from this download. SVE and EVE for GPP are custom-tailored and should not be mixed. SVT features are built-in.

**Known Issues**
 
* Clouds do not show up in main menu. Just a small bug with Kopernicus. not a big deal. Nothing is broken.

* Scatterer does not show in main menu or in tracking station. Again, normal. Nothing is broken.

* Mac and Linux Version uses quite a bit of ram (about 3gbs). Its either this, or have pinstripey planets and not be able to use this planet pack. Sorry.

* Running game in dx11 causes terrain textures to be pinstriped.

* Orbit lines jump around when zoomed out to outer planets in map view and tracking station. Its stock bug made more noticeable by Kopernicus
