TO INSTALL:

1. Create a new install of KSP and run once without mods. Then you may install GPP and other mods. Otherwise backup and remove your saves. Any existing career that uses the stock planets will be broken.

2. Install the latest version of Kopernicus. Its version must always match the KSP version or it will not work. Do not readily accept KSP game updates as between new KSP release and Kopernicus catch-up you may find things on Gael suddenly bound to a stock planet other than Kerbin. Install Community Resource Pack as well. GPP is very heavily resource-focused and without this, stock Ore scans may malfunction and reflect Null Refs.

3. Install GPP like anything else. Do it manually. Due to this mod's level of complexity there will be no CKAN support.

4. In GPP's Optional Mods folder see if there's something for another mod that you use. If there is, copy the GameData folder from inside each one and allow it to overwrite everything. The affected mod needs to already be installed. Kerbal Konstructs with KSC++ is patched and included whole. If you use Scatterer, reinstall it from among GPP's Optional Mods. It's configured differently.

5. If you use SVE, EVE,and SVT delete them completely then reinstall from this download. SVE and EVE for GPP are custom-tailored and should not be mixed. SVT features are built-in.


Changelog:

**v1.x**
* Added Sigma Binary: ...We're not telling you where. ;) 

* Enabled MechJeb to acknowledge KSC default location.

* Far-reaching body updates:

  * Simplified biome distributions on the noisier of biome maps.
  
  * Optimized color textures to lose excess file size but keep all quality.
  
  * Optimized Nero color and biomes to match ring tilt.
  
  * Optimized terrain elevations so KER and the like can honestly tell where sea level is.
  
* Strategia updates.

* Added gentle slope to KSC Island shores.

* Updated Texture Replacer.

**v1.1**

* Revised all biome map colors to resemble planets' surfaces/easy on the eyes.

* Strategia compatibility.

* Improved scatter objects for Gael and Tellumo.

* Improves Scatterer effects for nearly all atmospheric bodies.

* Improved EVE: Better particles for snow on Tellumo and Gael. All gas giants have have moving cloud bands with simulated tilt. 
  *Snow on Gael is no longer on the poles. It is now scattered just below the north polar region and above the south polar region.

* Sigma Dimensions: 3.2x, 6.4x, 10x.

* Changed the following worlds signficiantly: Iota, Tellumo, Gratian, Geminus, Otho, Hephaestus, Jannah, Gauss, Loki, Nero, Muse, Argo (and fixed all pole pinching).

  * Also retextured Ciro and added biomes.

* Niven atmosphere pressure raised slightly, height raised to 65km.

* Added SFX: IVA under pressure, splashdown, quieter launch clamps.

* Gael updates

  * Iota now has different biomes and flat areas but they won't be obvious to the naked eye.
  
  * Ceti now has science definitions.
  
  * Gael has a new Reefs biome with custom science, and discreet shores biomes to help identify the three supercontinents.
  
* Fixed default sun intensity. Brightness patches no longer needed.

* KSC now oriented Eastward (but is still off-equator)

  * KSC++ features aligned to fit.
  
  * KSC isle topology changed.
  
  * KSC Switcher support with 6 alternate locations including an equatorial one, like stock.

* Fixed RemoteTech support. Gael now has 7 ground stations and is properly ID'd by deployed satellites.

* Thalia and Icarus improvements. Improved so much that you'll need to bring radiators.

* Waypoint Manager icons for every celestial body.

* Buffed karbonite ocean harvester slightly and all Karbonite air-breathing engines except the radial turbojet. It's clearly described as super-slow and goes untouched.

* Decal Sticker support:

  * Apply your choice GPP flag as a decal with options for extending like a banner and spanning a cross-section of a craft.
  
* Added resource configs for Kerbalism. Other resource biases and optimizations also applied.


**Known Issues**
 
* Clouds do not show up in main menu. Just a small bug with Kopernicus. not a big deal. Nothing is broken.

* Scatterer does not show in main menu or in tracking station. Again, normal. Nothing is broken.

* Mac and Linux Version uses quite a bit of ram (about 3gbs). Its either this, or have pinstripey planets and not be able to use this planet pack. Sorry.

* Running game in dx11 causes terrain textures to be pinstriped.

* Orbit lines jump around when zoomed out to outer planets in map view and tracking station. Its stock bug made more noticeable by Kopernicus

* Sigma Dimensions does not play nice with KSCSwitcher AND KSC++. I recommend you remove KSC++ when using Sigma Dimensions
