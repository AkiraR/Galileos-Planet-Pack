**Known Issues**
 
* Clouds do not show up in main menu. Just a small bug with Kopernicus.. not a big deal. Nothing is broken.

* Scatterer does not show in main menu or in tracking station. Again, normal. Nothing is broken.

* Mac and Linux Version uses quite a bit of ram (about 3gbs). its either this, or have pinstripey planets and not be able to use this planet pack.. sorry.

* Running game in dx11 causes terrain textures to be pinstriped.
