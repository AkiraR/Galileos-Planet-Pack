TO INSTALL:

1. Create a new install of KSP and run once with zero mods. Install Kopernicus, ModularFlightIntegrator (part of Kopernicus) and ModuleManager.dll within GameData\ and run KSP again. No planet mod works without these. They are also not included in this package. If, however, you're not creating a new install then backup and remove your saves. Any existing playthrough will be broken.

2. Install GPP and ensure that KSP always launches in 64-bit (KSP_x64.exe on Windows). Your PC should have no less than 8GB RAM.

3. Use CKAN if that's your cup of tea and install Final Frontier and the visual mods except Scatterer and SVE. Install any of the remaining bundled mods if they suit you: Scatterer, TextureReplacer, Kerbal Konstructs with KSC++.


Changelog:

**v1.x**

* Support Scatterer v0.03 and renamed bundled SVE to GPPVE to cure confusion status.
  
  * Removed Medium SVE/GPPVE option to shave download size. The difference between Medium and High was minimal too.

* Reduced the following into MM patches, simplifying things overall and saving on download size:

  * Distant Object Enhancement; Final Frontier; Planetshine; Waypoint Manager; Sunflare toggle for whether Scatterer is present or not.
  
* Enabled MechJeb to acknowledge KSC default location.

* KSPedia implementation - With information on all major bodies!

* Far-reaching body updates:

  * Simplified biome distributions on the noisier of biome maps.
  
  * (Pending) Add biomes to Icarus.
  
  * (Pending) Fix for Hox atmosphere problem.
  
  * Optimized color textures to lose excess file size but keep all quality.
  
  * Visual updates to Niven!
  
  * Merged Gael and Tellumo cloud layers to consolidate textures.
  
  * Implemented EVE eclipses. Vacuum bodies now receive shadows (when Scatterer is not installed).
  
  * Optimized Nero color and biomes to match ring tilt.
  
  * Added slight tilt to Otho and Gauss.
  
  * Raised Lili's SOI to 40km to un-break Lili Orbital Survey contracts.
  
  * Optimized terrain elevations so KER and the like can honestly tell where sea level is.
  
  * Added anomalies and more PQSMod tweaks to some worlds. This includes terrain jitter and performance drain, especially at Tellumo.
  
  * Improved texure details even more on some worlds.
  
  * Changed Flight Globals to enable certain provisions and prevent a related issue.

* Added "Career Saver" and RemoteTech patches as Flight Globals change will cause other issues (specifically: break existing game saves).
  
* Strategia updates.

* Updated deltaV map.

* Disabled IVA sounds due to unforseen complication.

* Full Kerbalism support.

* Gael updates:

  * Lowered KSC island height and made shoreline friendly to enter/exit the ocean. Updated KSC++ and island biomes accordingly.
  
  * Changed Initial Rotation to put sunrise at 01:30 UTC.
  
  * Tuned Semi-major Axis so years are exactly 426.0 days long.
  
  * Renamed the Kerbin World-Firsts Society to Gaelean Historians Collective.
  
  * Minor adjustments to terrain and biome maps.

* Updated Texture Replacer.

* Custom loading screen!

* Various other new bells and whistles.

**Known Issues**
 
* Clouds do not show up in main menu. Just a small bug with Kopernicus. not a big deal. Nothing is broken.

* Scatterer does not show in main menu or in tracking station. Again, normal. Nothing is broken.

* Mac and Linux Version uses quite a bit of ram (about 3gbs). Its either this, or have pinstripey planets and not be able to use this planet pack. Sorry.

* Running game in dx11 causes terrain textures to be pinstriped.

* Orbit lines jump around when zoomed out to outer planets in map view and tracking station. Its stock bug made more noticeable by Kopernicus

* Sigma Dimensions does not play nice with KSCSwitcher AND KSC++. I recommend you remove KSC++ when using Sigma Dimensions
